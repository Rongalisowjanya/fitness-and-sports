    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>Physical fitness is a general state of health and well-being and, more specifically, the ability to perform
        aspects of sports, occupations and daily activities. Physical fitness is generally achieved through proper
        nutrition, moderate-vigorous physical exercise, physical activity, and sufficient rest.</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>People with intellectual disabilities have high prevalence of physical inactivity and high rates of preventable
        health conditions, including obesity and cardiovascular disease. Increased participation in fitness and wellness
        activities can improve their overall health and well-being. However, many fitness and wellness organizations do
        not know how to effectively serve this population nor how to support their inclusion into their programs. </p>

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <p>To help reduce the high prevalence of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and physical inactivity among people with
        intellectual disabilities it is essential for fitness and wellness professionals to supporting their inclusion.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Teach staff about intellectual disabilities and ensure everyone understands how to modify activities for
            people
            of all abilities.
        </li>
        <li>Update programs to be more user friendly for people with intellectual disabilities by using a variety of
            communication methods such as verbal instructions, modelling, written and visual/pictorial instructions.
        </li>
        <li>Use concise, easy-to-understand (non-technical) language in all verbal and written communications. This
            includes membership/registration paperwork and marketing materials. Consider providing individualized
            support for people with intellectual disabilities where appropriate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ask the experts â€“ people with intellectual disabilities - to provide feedback on any programmatic and
            organizational changes.
